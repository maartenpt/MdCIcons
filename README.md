# Manuel de Codage Icons

This is a Javascript library that can create SVG images for hieroglyphs encoded in the Manuel de Codage (MdC) standard.

This library is independent from the library that contains a (draft of a) Javascript version of the JSESH hieroglyphs editor. 

You can try out this library on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/maartenes/ovgr912c/)
