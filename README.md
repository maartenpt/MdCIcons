# Manuel de Codage Icons

This is a Javascript library that can create SVG images for hieroglyphs encoded in the Manuel de Codage (MdC) standard.

The library will generate SVG images for all hieroglyphs on a page - similar to the way amazingfonts produce icons. The default is to look for all the spans of the class `token-glyphs`, and produce the SVG as the innerHTML based on the MdC code in the `@title` attribute. So it will produce Hieroglyphs for all elements of the following form:

```
<span class="token-glyphs" title="M17-X1"></span>
```

You initiate the function as follows:

```
<script>MdCIcons.draw();</script>
```

Each SVG will combine base glyphs into carats. The base glyphs (gardiner numbers) will be generated in a hidden DIV. Base glyphs that have a unicode symbol will (by default) be generated as text elements, while all glyphs that do not have a unicode symbol will be loaded as raw SVG over Ajax. So the base glyph A1 will be generated as text (ð“€€) while A71 is not in the Unicode block, so it will be loaded from a file A71.svg at the specified server, by default from the JavaScriptSesh project: ![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmord/JavaScriptSesh/master/images/glyphs/A71.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmord/JavaScriptSesh/master/images/glyphs/A71.svg).  

The `draw` function can take a JSON object as its argument, where options can be specified:

| Features | Values | Description |
|----------|---------|------------|
| lineheight | int | height of the SVG image |
| unicode | bool | when set to false, the system will always use SVG images from the glyph URL |
| svgurl | string | URL where there the individual glyphs will be loaded from |
